# dilution_calculator
A simple dilution calculator which uses the Dart equations LUSolver to calculate the volumes of stock solutions needed to create a desired dilution with specified concentration(s) of stock solutions.
No checking is performed and negative volumes can result when the input are not logical.

Great idea! Let's modify the general formulation to always **include water (or another solvent)** as an additional stock solution.

### **Updated General Case with Water**
We now consider \( n \) stock solutions **plus water**, making the total number of components **\( n+1 \)**.

- **Stock solutions:**
  - Each stock solution \( i \) has a concentration **\( C_{i} \)**.
  - Volume used: **\( V_{i} \)**.

- **Water (or solvent):**
  - Water has **zero** concentration for all substances: \( C_{\text{water}, j} = 0 \).
  - Volume used: **\( V_w \)**.

- **Final mixture:**
  - The target concentration for each substance in the final solution is **\( C_j' \)**.
  - Total volume of the final solution: **\( V_f \)**.

### **Updated System of Equations**
For each **substance \( j \)**, the total amount in the final solution must match the total contributed by stock solutions:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_{ij} V_i + C_{\text{water},j} V_w = V_f C_j'
\]

Since **water contains no solutes**, its concentration for any substance is **0**, so the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_{ij} V_i = V_f C_j'
\]

**Total volume constraint:**
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} V_i + V_w = V_f
\]

### **Matrix Form with Water**
Now, our system can be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 
C_{11} & C_{21} & \dots & C_{n1} & 0 \\ 
C_{12} & C_{22} & \dots & C_{n2} & 0 \\ 
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\ 
C_{1m} & C_{2m} & \dots & C_{nm} & 0 \\ 
1 & 1 & \dots & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \\ \vdots \\ V_n \\ V_w \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} V_f C_1' \\ V_f C_2' \\ \vdots \\ V_f C_m' \\ V_f \end{bmatrix}
\]

### **Explanation of the Terms:**
- **Coefficient matrix \( A \)**:  
  - Same as before, but now with an extra **water column**, which has **0s** in the concentration rows and **1** in the volume row.

- **Unknown vector \( \mathbf{x} \)**:  
  \[
  \mathbf{x} =
  \begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ V_2 \\ \vdots \\ V_n \\ V_w \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  This now includes the volume of water \( V_w \).

- **Right-hand side vector \( \mathbf{b} \)**:
  \[
  \mathbf{b} =
  \begin{bmatrix} V_f C_1' \\ V_f C_2' \\ \vdots \\ V_f C_m' \\ V_f \end{bmatrix}
  \]

### **Will This Work for \( n = 1 \)?**
Yes! If we only have **one stock solution and water** (\( n = 1 \)), our matrix equation reduces to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} C_1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\ V_w \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} V_f C_1' \\ V_f \end{bmatrix}
\]

Solving:
1. From the second equation:  
   \[
   V_1 + V_w = V_f
   \]
   so \( V_w = V_f - V_1 \).

2. Substituting into the first equation:
   \[
   C_1 V_1 = V_f C_1'
   \]

   Solving for \( V_1 \):
   \[
   V_1 = \frac{V_f C_1'}{C_1}
   \]

3. Finally, compute \( V_w \):
   \[
   V_w = V_f - \frac{V_f C_1'}{C_1}
   \]

This means **if dilution is needed**, the system automatically accounts for it by adding water.

### **Summary:**
- This new formulation **always** works, even when \( n = 1 \), by allowing for dilution using water.
- The system **automatically finds the necessary water volume** if stock solutions alone cannot meet the target concentrations.
- The **total volume constraint ensures the final solution has the correct amount**.
